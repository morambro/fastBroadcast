\subsection{Architecture}

In figure \ref{fig:architecture} is shown a simple diagram of the architecture used from both Android application and Desktop application. We used a \textit{Event Bus} architectural pattern, in order to obtain a high decoupling degree between all the modules.

\end{figure}

This kind of architecture lets new algorithm modules to be tested, just registering them to the \textit{Event Bus} as \textit{Components}, listening for required events generated by GPS (if exists) and WI-FI, and generating events to exchange data or to move to another position.
