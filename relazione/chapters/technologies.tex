\section{Technologies}

Our project uses Android devices instead of vehicles, using their Wi-fi connectivity to communicate each other, especially adopting \direct standard. Android SDK's APIs from 14 enables the use of these technology to create small wireless devices networks, where one of the devices is used as an \emph{Access Point}. \direct specification is available only for purchase from Wi-fi Alliance\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} website\cite{wifi_direct}.
Basically a network created with Android \direct APIs is called \emph{group}. A \emph{group} has an owner (the access point), and one or more other devices. In the network the only available IP address is group owner's. 
Using \direct on Android devices is not possible to connect devices without user's permission.
