\section{Fast Broadcast Algorithm}
\label{sec:fast_broadcast}
The Fast Broadcast Algorithm provides an easy-to-implement method to estimate a vehicle WI-FI range and to quickly transmit messages over large distances. The algorithm does not require any pre-existent network infrastructure, and is essentially divided in two phases:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{Estimation phase}: in this phase time is divided into \textit{turns}, and at each turn $T$ a vehicle (one per turn) sends an \emph{Hello message}, containing information about its estimated wireless range and its position. All vehicles continuosly exchange \emph{Hello Messages} and use the contained information to update its estimated range.
		\item \emph{Broadcast phase}: once a vehicle receives an \textit{Alert Message}, it needs to forward it to the following ones. To prevent network flooding and unnecessary collisions, when a vehicle receives an Alert, it computes a \textit{Contention Window} and picks a random time to wait before forwarding the message within its maximum. If while waiting the vehicle receives the same message it is meant to forward, than it simply discards it because the message was already farwarded by someone else.
	\end{itemize} 
	
This brief introduction roughly describes the algorithm idea. We will focus on our implementation in the next sections.
