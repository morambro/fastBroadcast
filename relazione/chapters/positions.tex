\section{Position changing}
\label{sec:position_change}

To simulate the presence of multiple devices, we generated a list of coordinates on a straight line, and dinamically assigned the right position to each device\footnote{The implementation is explained in the next section}. In figure \ref{fig:positions} is shown an example of how positions are dinamically reassigned. Suppose we have four devices, let's called them A, B, C and D, and suppose also we have eight different positions. At the beginning, we have A, B, C and D assigned rispectively on positions 1, 2, 3 and 4. At a certain moment device A sends an \emph{Alert message} to all the other three devices. As soon as it sends the messages, device A moves to position 5. Other devices compute \textit{Contention Window} and wait for a random time. Let's assume now that device C's timeout occours, so it forwards the message: as required by the algorithm, devices B and D stops themselves from forwarding data too (because they just received the message they were about to forward), and device B also moves from position 2 to position 6, reconsidering the message again after moving. The process continues until last position available is reached.
With this iterative mechanism we can distribute a certain number of virtual devices on a straight line of arbitrary lenght. 
We also use distance filters to simultae real devices range: once one of the used devices hears a message he souldn't have to hear due to his supposed wireless range, he simply discards it.
