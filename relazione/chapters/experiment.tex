To test our testbed applications, we implemented Fast Broadcast algorithm (both for Android application and Desktop application). Simulation used a set of fake position distributed on a straight line, each at a random distance between $275$ and $325$ meters from the following. In figure \ref{fig:positions_experiment} a graphical representation can be seen. They covers approximately $8$ kilometers.

\subsubsection{Android application}
To test our Android application we used three Android devices. The simulation ran with the following parameters:
	* SLOT_SIZE = 
	* CW_MIN = 
	* CW_MAX =
