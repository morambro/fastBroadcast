\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{R}{esearch} on Vehicolar Networks makes large use of software simulations, this because it is unfeasible to build a vehicular network of real vehicles that can act as relays of a message that could travel long distances.
To reduce costs, a possible solution is using common and small devices like smartphones to perform real tests carring them on vehicles, or to perform simulations.
To develop a complete testbed application, different features must be provided:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Possibility to use GPS location or fake positions.
	\item Wireless connectivity.
\end{itemize}

This features are very easy to supply: the most of the smartphones in commerce has GPS and WI-FI devices installed, and their Operating Systems provide APIs to use them.
The application we developed, involves the use of a finite number of devices each running the same application. Fake locations are used to put our devices on a straight line, with random distances between them, in order to simulate an higher number of vehicles, and changes each device's virtual position when needed.
